# Insurance Business Overview Project Report

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


1)Data Collection & Flat File Conversion

Gathered data from multiple sources related to policy distribution, claim amounts, customer demographics, and vehicle information.

Transformed these individual datasets into a flat file format to streamline data integration and ensure compatibility with Power BI.

This allowed for efficient data modeling and simplified complex relationships within the data.

2)Data Modeling with Star Schema

Implemented a Star Schema design to organize data with a central fact table (Policy and Claim Information) linked to multiple dimension tables (e.g., State, Gender, Car Brand, Policy Details).

This structure provided a clear, logical framework for analyzing premium collections, claims, and customer demographics, optimizing the performance of the Power BI dashboard.

3)Metrics and KPI Definitions

Defined key metrics critical to assessing business performance, such as:
1)Policy Numbers (1002 policies)
2)Total Premium Collected ($1.26M)
3)Total Claim Amount ($53M)
4)Capital Gains/Losses ($25M gains and $27M losses)
5)Policy Deductibles ($1M)
6)Property Claims ($7M)
7)Dashboard Visualizations and Analysis

4)Policy Distribution by State and Gender:

Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana are the primary states, with Ohio having the highest distribution (354 policies).

Policy distribution by gender shows a near-equal split, with slightly more policies held by females (537) than males (465).

1)Annual Premium Collected by State:
Ohio led in premium collection ($447K), followed by Illinois ($424K) and Indiana ($389K).
2)Claim Amount Analysis by State:
Claims were highest in Ohio ($18.6M), followed by Illinois ($17.9M) and Indiana ($16.4M), indicating potential areas for claim cost optimization.
3)Policy Distribution by Car Brand:
Dodge, Saab, and Subaru have the highest policy counts among car brands, each with 80 policies. Honda has the lowest count with 55 policies, providing insights into customer preferences.

4)Combined Single Limit by State:

A breakdown of single policy limits by state shows variance, with Illinois holding higher limits for the 250/500 category, indicating diverse policy structures across regions.

5)Insights on Policy and Claim Trends

Policy Deductibles and Umbrella Limit: Ohio holds the highest policy deductibles ($0.41M), followed by Indiana and Illinois.

The umbrella limit is slightly higher in Illinois ($0.41M) than in Ohio ($0.38M), showing variations in deductible preferences among states.

Policy Distribution by Occupation:The analysis reveals that farming and machine operators represent the top and bottom occupations for policy distribution, providing potential for targeted marketing efforts.

6)Recommendations for Business Optimization

Based on the insights, strategies can be formed to optimize customer engagement, such as targeting regions with high premium collections and claim amounts for customer retention programs.

Address high claim regions like Ohio for cost management and refine deductible offerings based on state-specific trends.
Leverage customer demographic insights to tailor policies, promotions, and engagement efforts, especially for high-policy segments such as Dodge and Saab owners.

7)Dashboard Functionality and User Interaction

Filters for Year, Quarter, Month, Policy State, Gender, Age Category, and Model Category allow users to interactively explore data by specific dimensions, providing a customizable analysis experience.

The “Reset” button enables a quick return to the default view, enhancing usability for stakeholders exploring multiple scenarios.

8)Final Insights and Business Impact

This dashboard facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the insurance portfolio, policyholder demographics, and claim patterns.

It supports data-driven decisions, enabling more efficient claims processing, customer engagement, and strategic planning to boost profitability.


# Report on the Comprehensive Claims and Fraud Insights Dashboard 2

Fraud Reported: 247 cases
Police Reports Available: 316 cases
Total Bodily Injuries: 662 reported
Vehicle Claims: 38 million

2)Incident Types by State:

New York shows the highest number of incidents involving multi-vehicle collisions (119), parked car incidents (16), and single-vehicle collisions (112), alongside some vehicle thefts (15).
South Carolina follows closely with notable incidents across all categories.
West Virginia has significant single-vehicle collision claims (85) and a moderate amount of vehicle theft (28).

3)Collision Types:

Front Collisions: The highest number is reported in New York (85), followed by other states with varying figures.
Rear Collisions: South Carolina leads with 87 incidents, while others range between 32 and 78.
Side Collisions: Incidents peak in West Virginia (68) and remain significant in other states.

4)Total Vehicle Claims by Damage Type:

Major Damage: Ohio reports the highest at 99 claims, followed by Indiana and Illinois.
Minor Damage: Ohio again leads (126), with Illinois (116) and Indiana (112) closely trailing.
Total Loss: Ohio records the most (101), with Illinois and Indiana reporting slightly lower numbers.
Trivial Damage: Illinois (36) has higher numbers compared to Indiana (26) and Ohio (28).

5)Bodily Injuries by Policy State:

Illinois has a significant number of cases with two bodily injuries (123) and one bodily injury (95).
Indiana and Ohio also show high counts for both categories, with slight variations.

# Summary

This dashboard highlights states with high incidences of vehicle-related claims, showing varying risk levels and potential fraudulent activities. New York, South Carolina, and Ohio are notable for high incident rates. Rear and side collisions represent significant claim types, while bodily injuries remain a major aspect in Illinois and other key states. This data supports insights into regional risk factors and guides strategic decisions for claims management and fraud prevention.
