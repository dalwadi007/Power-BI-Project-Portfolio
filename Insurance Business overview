# Insurance Business Overview Project Report

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


1)Data Collection & Flat File Conversion

Gathered data from multiple sources related to policy distribution, claim amounts, customer demographics, and vehicle information.

Transformed these individual datasets into a flat file format to streamline data integration and ensure compatibility with Power BI.

This allowed for efficient data modeling and simplified complex relationships within the data.

2)Data Modeling with Star Schema

Implemented a Star Schema design to organize data with a central fact table (Policy and Claim Information) linked to multiple dimension tables (e.g., State, Gender, Car Brand, Policy Details).

This structure provided a clear, logical framework for analyzing premium collections, claims, and customer demographics, optimizing the performance of the Power BI dashboard.

3)Metrics and KPI Definitions

Defined key metrics critical to assessing business performance, such as:
1)Policy Numbers (1002 policies)
2)Total Premium Collected ($1.26M)
3)Total Claim Amount ($53M)
4)Capital Gains/Losses ($25M gains and $27M losses)
5)Policy Deductibles ($1M)
6)Property Claims ($7M)
7)Dashboard Visualizations and Analysis

4)Policy Distribution by State and Gender:

Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana are the primary states, with Ohio having the highest distribution (354 policies).

Policy distribution by gender shows a near-equal split, with slightly more policies held by females (537) than males (465).

1)Annual Premium Collected by State:
Ohio led in premium collection ($447K), followed by Illinois ($424K) and Indiana ($389K).
2)Claim Amount Analysis by State:
Claims were highest in Ohio ($18.6M), followed by Illinois ($17.9M) and Indiana ($16.4M), indicating potential areas for claim cost optimization.
3)Policy Distribution by Car Brand:
Dodge, Saab, and Subaru have the highest policy counts among car brands, each with 80 policies. Honda has the lowest count with 55 policies, providing insights into customer preferences.

4)Combined Single Limit by State:

A breakdown of single policy limits by state shows variance, with Illinois holding higher limits for the 250/500 category, indicating diverse policy structures across regions.

5)Insights on Policy and Claim Trends

Policy Deductibles and Umbrella Limit: Ohio holds the highest policy deductibles ($0.41M), followed by Indiana and Illinois.

The umbrella limit is slightly higher in Illinois ($0.41M) than in Ohio ($0.38M), showing variations in deductible preferences among states.

Policy Distribution by Occupation:The analysis reveals that farming and machine operators represent the top and bottom occupations for policy distribution, providing potential for targeted marketing efforts.

6)Recommendations for Business Optimization

Based on the insights, strategies can be formed to optimize customer engagement, such as targeting regions with high premium collections and claim amounts for customer retention programs.

Address high claim regions like Ohio for cost management and refine deductible offerings based on state-specific trends.
Leverage customer demographic insights to tailor policies, promotions, and engagement efforts, especially for high-policy segments such as Dodge and Saab owners.

7)Dashboard Functionality and User Interaction

Filters for Year, Quarter, Month, Policy State, Gender, Age Category, and Model Category allow users to interactively explore data by specific dimensions, providing a customizable analysis experience.

The “Reset” button enables a quick return to the default view, enhancing usability for stakeholders exploring multiple scenarios.

8)Final Insights and Business Impact

This dashboard facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the insurance portfolio, policyholder demographics, and claim patterns.

It supports data-driven decisions, enabling more efficient claims processing, customer engagement, and strategic planning to boost profitability.
